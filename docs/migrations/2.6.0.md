# Version 2.6.0

## `zb build` CLI command

`zb build` no longer accepts a list of platforms or a special argument `all`. Invoke this command several times to compile for several platforms.

I.e. instead of `zb build tizen webos` use `zb build tizen` followed by `zb build webos`.

## `AbstractPlatform.pack`

`AbstractPlatform.pack` is meant to repalce `AbstractPlatform.buildApp`. The difference is that the new method is invoked after application `index.html` and static files were processed and only needs to pack them into platform artifact and does not need to call `BuildHelper` methods to build html application.

To migrate, platforms should replace `buildApp` implementation with `pack`, remove calls to `writeIndexHTML` and `copyStaticFiles`, assume `index.html` and all the necessary files already exist in build dir and proceed with platform-specific processing and packaging an artifact.
 
 No migration should be necessary for application as the changes are backwards compatible, albeit this requires running compilation twice.

## `generated/package-info` removal

`generated/package-info` was properly removed following its deprecation in 2.5.0. See 2.5.0 [migration guide](./2.5.0.md).
