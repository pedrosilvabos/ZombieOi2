# Version 2.5.0

## `generated/package-info`

This file was deprecated because of concerns that it exposed too much information about application source code, dependencies, development environment and possibly configs.

The three most commonly used properties from package.json were: `name`, `version` and value of `dependencies.zombiebox`. They were replaced with defines (`generated/define`): `NPM_PACKAGE_NAME`, `NPM_PACKAGE_VERSION` and `ZOMBIEBOX_VERSION` respectively.

For now `generated/package-info` is not removed for backwards compatibility, but it will be in the next release.

To migrate if you were using one of the three aforementioned properties, use the new defines.

If you were using other properties from `package.json`, add your own defines in app config to pass them to runtime. For example:

```js
const packageJson = require('./package.json');

module.exports = () => ({
	define: {
		NPM_LICENSE: packageJson['license']
	}
})
```

## `MouseEvent` in `processKey`

`IKeyHandler`'s `processKey` now accepts `KeyboardEvent` and `MouseEvent` as opposed to previously accepting `KeyboardEvent` and `WheelEvent`. 
Particularly this means that widgets, layers and Application will now receive additional types of events in its second parameter, such as `click` `MouseEvent` (previously the second parameter was not present).
This allows them to differentiate whether `ENTER` came from keyboard or mouse click.
