# Version 2.2.0

## CSS `@import`

This version introduced processing of css `@import` declarations. This allows more control over what files are included and in which order.

As a drawback (or not), if it's enabled you should now always include all CSS files.

To enable import processing, set config propery `postcss.importEntryPoints` to array of files from which import trees start growing.

Previous behavior of indiscriminately including all CSS files is also preserved by default (if `importEntryPoints` is not set).

`@import` statements can use the same aliases as js modules:

```css
@import "ui/widgets/throbber/throbbes.css";
```

Dev server will natively import these files after resolving their paths while build process will resolve and inline them. 

## Other changes

* Dev server no longer runs `postcss.extraPlugins` against project css files.
* `postcss.extraPlugins` are now run after bundling.
* `StylesCache` and `Applicatione.getStylesCache` were removed.
