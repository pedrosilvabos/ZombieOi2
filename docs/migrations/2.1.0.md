# Version 2.1.0

## Video Container removal

`.zb-video-container` was removed from `AbstractApplication`. HTML5 Video was the only one actually using it, but the fact that this element was part of Device and Video APIs required all implementations of `AbstractDevice` and `AbstractVideo` to depend on `Application` and its instance introducing unreasonable and cyclical dependencies.

### Migration for applications
Whenever you call `Device.createVideo`, add a `Rect` argument with desired video fullscreen dimensions. Most likely it's application viewport, so call `Rect.createByClientRect(app.getBody().getBoundingClientRect())`.

### Migration for platforms
Platforms not using `HTML5Video` will work with no migrations, but produce compilation warnings.

* Remove `{HTMLElement} videoContainer` parameter from `Device` constructor
* Add `Rect` parameter to `createVideo` and pass to `Video` constructor
* Add `Rect` parameter to `Video` constructor
* If platforms requires video container, create this element yourself in html body
